This project presents an interactive web application to visualize and explore the results of advanced research aimed at predicting agricultural food production trends. It utilizes various data analysis techniques and machine learning models to provide insights into global food security and agricultural economics.

**Authors:** Ori Shai, Daniel Roei, Neta Tevet  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Abraham Yosipof  
*A final project for the Academic Center for Law and Business.*

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Interactive Dashboard:** Explore research findings through a dynamic and user-friendly interface built with React and Vite.
-   **Advanced Model Comparison:** Compare the performance and forecasts of three different machine learning models: ARIMA, TabPFN, and a custom Stacking (Blended) model.
-   **Rich Data Visualization:**
    -   **Food Production Index:** Track historical and forecasted food production indices for over 180 countries.
    -   **Correlation Matrix:** Understand the relationships between 7 key variables, including pesticide use, carbon emissions, and population data.
    -   **3D PCA & K-Means Clustering:** Visualize country clusters and influential components in a 3D space using Plotly.js.
-   **Interactive Methodology Explorer:** A dynamic flow diagram built with React Flow, detailing every step of the research process from data collection to model validation.

## üî¨ Research Methodology
Our research follows a comprehensive, multi-stage process:

1.  **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Aggregating data from sources like the FAO and World Bank, followed by normalization, cleaning, and imputation of missing values using a Random Forest model.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizing PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-Means for clustering to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in the data.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Developing and training three distinct models (ARIMA, TabPFN, and a Blended Stacking model) to forecast the Food Production Index.
4.  **Validation & Analysis:** Rigorously evaluating model performance using RMSE and comparing their predictive power.


The entire methodology is visualized in our **interactive flow diagram** within the application, allowing for a deep dive into each specific step.
